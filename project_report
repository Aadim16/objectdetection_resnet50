# Object Detection Using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to object detection tasks using popular architectures like YOLO and R-CNN. It was developed as part of the Deep Learning (CSE4006) course at VIT-AP University.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

Object detection is a computer vision technique that enables the identification and localization of objects within images. This notebook explores:

- The fundamentals of object detection
- Differences between **YOLOv7** and **R-CNN** models
- Implementation insights and visual results
- Comparative analysis of the performance of each model

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- `Object_detection_DL_project_.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all the code, analysis, and visualizations
- Sample image inputs and output plots (if any included later)
- Results section comparing model performances

## ðŸ§  Models Covered

- **YOLOv7** (You Only Look Once)
  - Real-time object detection
  - Highly optimized for speed and performance
- **R-CNN** (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network)
  - More accurate but computationally intensive
  - Better suited for detailed analysis

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on implementation)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
